<p>An intense and detailed exploration of git, that covers a broad range of commands and operations you will use in your daily activities, with an emphasis on the details of how git works and how to use it to save you time and effort.</p>
<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expand your confidence with git and gain a better understanding of how it works</li>
<li>Learn new commands and new ways to apply commands that are already familiar</li>
<li>Loaded with directed "hands-on" exercises</li>
<li>Presented to be used as instruction now and reference later</li>
</ul>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<p>If you are a software developer, who feels comfortable using the Command Line and have had <em>some</em> exposure to git you have probably developed a habit like this:</p>
<pre><code>
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -a
  $ git push origin master

</code></pre>

<p>In this series of videos, we will explore the details of how git works and provide a richer understanding and better command over your source control management.<br />
You will gain confidence and knowledge to apply when you face those 'sticky' problems with source control using git.</p>
<p>Get <a href="http://goo.gl/sTcJ0k">a preview on YouTube</a></p>
<h3>Brief Description</h3>
<p>Mastering Git is an exploration of solo and collaborative Source Control Management with the intention of expanding and improving your confidence and expertise with git.<br />
Even if you use git regularly, you will benefit from the additional insights into the commands, tools, functions and internal operations of git.<br />
This presentation is the first of its kind since the release of Git version 2.0.</p>
<h3>What you will learn</h3>
<p>With Mastering Git, you will explore and learn these topics, many with "hands-on" exercises to deepen your understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Branch, remote Branch, Topic/Feature Branch</li>
<li>Merge need not be confusing and intimidating</li>
<li>Reset and Revert.  There is a reset button</li>
<li>A detailed look at the Commit Message and a philosophy on how to compose it</li>
<li>History in detail</li>
<li>Altering History to tell a better 'story' about your development project</li>
<li>Rebase is not so scary once you get to know it</li>
<li>Blame is not about calling someone out</li>
<li>Diff tool</li>
<li>Bisect is your best friend as a debugging asset</li>
<li>Patches with git</li>
<li>Submodules</li>
<li>Details and understanding of Stash</li>
<li>Aliases in git along with a set of common examples to get you started</li>
<li>A range of GUI clients for git</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Broad Sweep</h3>
<p>Even if you feel comfortable with the rather arcane commands and strange syntax of git, there are numerous subtleties that are relatively unknown.  Throughout the video, these are revealed and discussed in a friendly and engaging manner along with carefully guided exercises that provide "real world" practice.<br />
Exploring the details of how git performs its seemingly 'magic' operations helps to clarify the sometimes puzzling behavior when working with it; saving you time and reducing worry about losing your work.</p>
<h3>The Plot Thickens</h3>
<p>Working on your own computer or the online editor demonstrated in the course, you will tackle scenarios like:<br />
 - Merge conflicts that inhibit your ability to complete a 'Pull' operation - How to Undo when you make a mistake with git and not lose any of your work - Using Rebase and Squash to rewrite the git History You will gain a clear understanding of numerous git commands (Bisect, Stash and Alias, to name a few) with "hands-on" exercises to gain valuable experience in a 'practice' environment <br />
The git History is so important to managing a project, you will explore some philosophical ideas about how to formulate a proper Commit Message.</p>
<h3>The Conclusion</h3>
<p>Mastering Git will help the novice and expert alike by providing a chance to explore and uncover many subtle nuances of git commands including the differences now introduced with Git version 2.0.<br />
Rather than jump to a web search and pore through several pages of StackOverflow questions, you will be the one with the intimate knowledge and expertise to solve that tough git situation.<br />
Perhaps you will be the one providing answers to others in trouble!</p>
